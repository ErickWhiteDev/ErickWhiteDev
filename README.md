I'm an aerospace engineering major at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/), currently in my sophomore year.

My interest in space has been with me since I was very young (I started out with astronomy from my backyard in Germany 
when I was only three or four years old and haven't stopped since then), but my interest in aerospace engineering was 
more recent - I wanted to combine my interests in the aerospace field, programming, math, physics, and engineering, and 
aerospace engineering provided me a perfect way to do so.

I've been interested in computer science for a long time (I started coding in Scratch when I was in elementary school, 
moved on to Python, Java, and other languages in high school,  and now code primarily in MATLAB and C++); I continue to 
pursue my interest in programming through a minor in computer science.

I've been interested in math even longer than computer science; I remember being gifted a book on the history of 
mathematics when I was in elementary school and bringing it with me on a family trip to Italy (during which I read the 
whole thing). Both pure and applied math are very intriguing to me, although (since it aligns better with engineering) 
I am now pursuing an additional minor in applied math.
